# My-CV

A minimalistic, multi-page CV template with BibLaTeX support. My motivation was from [Doruk Ã‡etin](https://github.com/dcetin/Simple-CV).

## Usage

You can either fill the [basic template on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/simple-cv/wmsyrgqwwqnc), or edit the example CV provided here.
Note that the template needs to be compiled with XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX.
Code is tested on Windows with Texmaker/Biber/MikTeX/TeXLive.

To use the header with photo just replace the png file and uncomment the relevant lines in the main tex file.
Theme color and bibliography style can similarly be set at the top of the main tex file.
Template also supports Chinese and Cyrillic characters, you just need uncomment the relevant lines in the preamble.
